- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ssnowplow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in rowing and finally learning to code. My brother learned to code on his own years ago and I've always been somewhat intimitated about learning to do it. My job currently has me use a lot of Excel and Google Sheets, and learning to use some of the more advanced functions in both of them has helped me build confidence in trying to learn coding again.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of coding.
